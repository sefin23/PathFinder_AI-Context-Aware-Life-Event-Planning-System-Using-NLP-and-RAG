"""
Layer 3.2 — Knowledge Base Seed Script.

Usage:
    python -m backend.scripts.seed_knowledge_base

What it does:
  1. Initialises the DB (creates the knowledge_base table if needed).
  2. Inserts 30 curated requirement entries covering all Tier 1 life events.
  3. Calls Gemini Embedding 2 to embed each entry's content.
  4. Saves embeddings back to the DB.

Rules:
  - Idempotent: already-embedded entries are skipped.
  - No web scraping — all content is hand-curated from the Life Events Library.
  - Run this ONCE after first deployment, or after adding new entries.

Estimated time: ~2 minutes (30 Gemini API calls with rate-limit delay).
